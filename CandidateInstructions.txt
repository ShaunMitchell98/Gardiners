### Test Description
In the 'DeliveryService.cs' file you will find a method for delivering an order. At a high level the steps for delivering an order are:

 - Lookup the delivery partner that will be delivering the order
 - Check the delivery partner is able to deliver the order
 - Add to the delivery partners total orders processed till date and update the delivery partner in the backend
 
What we’d like you to do is refactor the code with the following things in mind:  
 - Adherence to SOLID principals
 - Testability  
 - Readability 

We’d also like you to add some unit tests to the Gardiners.Core.Tests project to show how you would test the code that you’ve produced. The only specific ‘rules’ are:  

 - The solution should build.
 - The tests should all pass.
 - You should not change the method signature of the DeliverOrder method.
 - The requirements should still be met after your refactoring

You are free to use any frameworks/NuGet packages that you see fit.  
 
You should plan to spend around an hour completing the exercise.
